# Playwright Test Summary

## Test Run Results

### Basic Tests (7/10 passing) ✅

**Passing Tests:**
- ✅ Homepage loads successfully
- ✅ Hero section displays correctly
- ✅ Navigation to sections works
- ✅ Project cards display
- ✅ Professional experience shows
- ✅ Responsive design works
- ✅ Download resume link exists

**Failing Tests:**
- ❌ Contact section heading mismatch (expected "Let's Connect", actual heading differs)
- ❌ Contact form placeholders mismatch (expected "Your email", actual "your@email.com")
- ❌ Education section has duplicate text causing selector issues

### Comprehensive Test Suite Status

Created comprehensive test files:
1. `tests/homepage.spec.ts` - Main single-page app tests
2. `tests/contact-form.spec.ts` - Contact form functionality tests  
3. `tests/navigation.spec.ts` - Smooth scrolling and navigation tests
4. `tests/performance.spec.ts` - Performance and accessibility tests
5. `tests/basic.spec.ts` - Simplified tests for core functionality

## Key Issues Found

1. **Selector Specificity**: Some elements have duplicate text causing "strict mode violation" errors
2. **Dynamic Content**: Form placeholders and headings don't match expected values
3. **Timing Issues**: Some navigation tests timeout due to smooth scrolling animations

## Recommendations

1. **Fix Duplicate Text**: Use more specific selectors or add data-testid attributes
2. **Update Test Expectations**: Match actual placeholder text and headings
3. **Add Wait Conditions**: Add proper waits for animations and dynamic content
4. **Use Data Attributes**: Add data-testid to key elements for reliable testing

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npx playwright test

# Run specific test file
npx playwright test tests/basic.spec.ts

# Run with UI mode
npx playwright test --ui

# Run with headed browser
npx playwright test --headed
```

## Next Steps

1. Fix the failing tests by updating selectors and expectations
2. Add data-testid attributes to key elements
3. Create visual regression tests
4. Set up CI/CD pipeline with automated testing
5. Add performance benchmarks
